# Sveltekit Playground

A project where I try out [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

## Developing

Once you have installed the dependencies, run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start a development server. It uses [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) under the hood so you can pass extra options to it (eg. `yarn dev --open` to open in a new browser window).

## Building

Run the `yarn build` and the `yarn preview` to view the app in production mode.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
